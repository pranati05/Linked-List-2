# Time Complexity : O(N)
# Space Complexity : O(1)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# First is we get the length of both the lists to check which list has greater length
# Then we iterate over the list which has greater length until it is the same length as the second list
# Then we can start to iterate simultaneously over two lists until they meet to get the intersection point if they dont then they will reach Null
